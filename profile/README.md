> VisActor is derived from a large number of visualization scenarios. While covering conventional visualization scenarios, it focuses on narrative visualization as a new point of emphasis and intelligent visualization as its goal. It has formed a visualization solution composed of multiple modules including rendering engine, visualization grammar, data analysis component, chart component, table component, GIS component, graph visualization component, and intelligent component.
